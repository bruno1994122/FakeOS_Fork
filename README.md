# FakeOS
A simple terminal **simulator** written in Python3.

## Setup
- The only dependence of this project is [**Art**](https://pypi.org/project/art/) module.
- There are some optional dependencies:
  - Nano Editor
  - IPython3
  
## Usage
Run the _main.py_ file, you can execute _python3 main.py_ or _./main.py_.
You will see the ASCII Art Text logo, a welcome message and the prompt, to get started, type _help_.

## Making apps
I decided to make it easier for users to create their own apps for FakeOS, just add a function to the _apps.py_ file with the code of you app.

## Files
There's a folder named home, where all the files of the "user" are saved by default, you can edit apps.py to use another folder.
